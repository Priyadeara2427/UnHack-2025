# 🚀 UNHACK 2025 – Hackathon at KLA 🏆

## 🌟 Introduction

This repository contains my journey and solutions for **UNHACK 2025**, a hackathon organized by **KLA**.

## 📅 Event Phases

- **📚 Learning Session & Practice Problem**  
  I took part in the learning sessions and completed all milestones in the practice problem statement.

- **🏢 Final Day at KLA Office**  
  The in-person hackathon ran from 9 AM to 6 PM. We received a problem with three milestones.  
  - ✅ I completed 2 out of 3 milestones.
  - 🧪 Each milestone had 9 test cases, and a validator showed how many tests passed or failed.

## 📜 Key Rules

- 🤖❌ I did not use any AI tools or Google help—everything was solved independently.
- 👨‍🏫 Mentors were available to help if anyone was stuck.

## 🎉 Outcome

- 🏫 After an intense, focused day of problem solving, the results were announced. I was honored to be included in the winners list and received a cash prize for my performance.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `📁 practice_problems/` – Code and output file for practice problems for all the milestones.
- `📄 pptx/` – Problem statements for pratice and final day.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- ⏱️ Enhanced problem-solving under time pressure
- 🐞 Improved debugging skills
- 🧠 Demonstrated ability to work without external aids
